This is my day-by-day learning journey, written in detail for Frontend (HTML, CSS,JS,REACT), along with other key activities.
Joined **10k Coders** and began my structured learning journey.

Introduction to **HTML** — structure (`<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`), headings, paragraphs, and basic formatting tags.  

Worked with **HTML tables** (`<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, `<th>`), border styling, and the `<summary>` tag in `<details>`. 

Used HTML **multimedia tags** — `<audio>`, `<video>`, `<source>`; practiced adding controls, autoplay, and loop.

Created and styled HTML **forms** with `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`, radio buttons, and checkboxes. 

Learned **semantic HTML tags** like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`.  

Git basics — creating repositories, `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`. 

Continued practicing Git — branching, `git status`, `git log`.
